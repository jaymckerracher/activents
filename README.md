# Activents Launchpad Project

## Link to the hosted version

## Summary
Activents is an events platform that allows staff members to create sporting events for their community. Staff members, alongside those with admin access, are allowed to create events that can be seen and interacted with by normal users of the site.

Users must have an account before they are allowed into the site, insuring that only authenticated users can sign up to the events that are being hosted. When a user signs up for an event, they are also able to link the event to their Google calendar, granted that they have linked their account with Google through the profile page, or doing so when they signed up.

## How to access the project
